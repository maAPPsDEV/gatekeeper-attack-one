# Solidity Game - Gatekeeper Attack

_Inspired by OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com), Gatekeeper One Level_

⚠️Do not try on mainnet!

## Task

Make it past the gatekeeper and register as an entrant.

_Hint:_

1. Remember what you've learned from the [Telephone](https://github.com/maAPPsDEV/telephone-attack) and [Token](https://github.com/maAPPsDEV/token-attack) games.
2. You can learn more about the special function `gasleft()`, in Solidity's documentation (see [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/units-and-global-variables.html) and [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/control-structures.html#external-function-calls)).

## What will you learn?

1. Solidity Security Consideration
2. **Underflow** and **Overflow** in use of unsigned integers

## What is the most difficult challenge?

**You won't get success to attack if the target contract has been complied in Solidity 0.8.0 or uppper** 🤔

I had tried to do everything in Solidity 0.8.5 at first time, but it didn't work, as it reverted transactions everytime it met underflow.

Finally, I found that Solidity included those checks by defaults while using sliencely more gas.

So, don't you need to use [`SafeMath`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol)?

## Source Code

⚠️This contract contains a bug or risk. Do not use on mainnet!

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Token {
  mapping(address => uint256) balances;
  uint256 public totalSupply;

  constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}

```

## Configuration

### Install Truffle cli

_Skip if you have already installed._

```
npm install -g truffle
```

### Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## Test and Attack!💥

### Run Tests

```
truffle develop
test
```

You should take ownership of the target contract successfully.

```
truffle(develop)> test
Using network 'develop'.


Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.
